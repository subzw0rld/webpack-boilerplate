# webpack-boilerplate
My own webpack's boilerplate for JS based projects (based on webpack's own tutorial @ https://webpack.js.org/).

## Scripts to run
- **npm run serve** for running the application on development environment at 8080.
- **npm run prod** for generating the production bundle inside the dist folder.
